# We start the code by importing the libraries.
# Numpy is used to implement the arrays.
import numpy as np
# Matplotlib is used to make the plots, later.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Timeit library is used only to calculate the machine time
# of the simulation.
import timeit

# We will also use functions that are in other files. 
# We put functions in separated files just to keep it 
# more organized.

# Ok. We have given all of the inputs. 
# Now we will define other parameters, based on the inputs.
# And then we will create the vectors and arrays.
